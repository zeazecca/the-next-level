        <h1>What&rsquo;s this?</h1>
        <p><sysname>The Next Level</sysname> is an alternate creature building & rating system for <sysname>Dungeons & Dragons 5e</sysname>, intended as a replacement for the default Challenge Rating system. Based on a level-by-level analysis of player characters and their abilities, <sysname>The Next Level</sysname> fixes common flaws, recalculating cumbersome number tables to be more intuitive and consistent:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Creature level = player level:</strong> A 3rd-level creature is a reasonable encounter for one 3rd-level player. Four players? Four creatures.</li>
            <li><strong>Encounters last 3 turns:</strong> Enough to have exciting and tactical encounters, little enough that combat slog is a thing of the past.</li>
            <li><strong>A 3-encounter adventuring day:</strong> The recommended 6-encounter adventuring day is a slog that poses little danger to your players for most of the game. <sysname>The Next Level</sysname> assumes 3 encounters each day; enough that players will worry about draining resources, but few enough to let you play through an entire day during a single game night.</li>
            <li><strong>Consistent rewards:</strong> Players level up each time they gain 1000 XP. Whether they are level 3 or level 13, that number never changes. The math is always the same, so you can focus on the narrative instead of boring XP calculations.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>How it works</h1>
        <p>On the surface, this system works just like the CR rules in the Dungeon Master&rsquo;s Guide: calculate a creature&rsquo;s offensive and defensive potential; combine those to get your level score. The number tables have been plugged into the interactive calculator at the top of the page: type in the numbers you already know, and the calculator will use judicious castings of <spell>Assess Creature</spell> to work out the remaining values. Move your mouse over the question mark symbols for a quick explanation.</p>
        <h1>Combat encounters</h1>
        <p>Encounter building is still being playtested; but the gist of it is not complicated. Just be warned that we of <sysname>The Next Level, inc.</sysname> take no responsibility for any total party kills that occur because of <sysname>The Next Level</sysname>.</p>
        <p>The table below lists XP values for creatures relative to player levels. Take the average level of your player characters; that is the party level. Creatures of the same level as the player characters are worth 80 XP. Multiply that by the number of players and you have an XP budget. XP increases linearly with the power level of a creature. So, a creature that is worth 160 XP is roughly twice as strong as a creature worth 80 XP, and four times as strong as a creature worth 40 XP.</p>

        <h1>Experience points</h1>
        <p>For combat encounters, count the XP each individual creature is worth and divide it equally among players. Players of a different level than the party level receive more or less <caps>XP</caps> according to the table above, if you want to give lower-leveled players a chance to catch up.</p>
        <p>Personally, I also hand out <caps>XP</caps> for roleplaying and good fun. My rules for non-combat <caps>XP</caps> are simple: 20 <caps>XP</caps> for a funny remark, or if a player does something in-character. 80 <caps>XP</caps> if they do major roleplaying, or something super creative. I also usually award inspiration at this point. Lastly, I award 120 <caps>XP</caps> when a major quest is completed, or if a player roleplays something despite it being majorly detrimental to their character.</p>
        <h1>From the MM: Hell Hounds</h1>
        <p>Let&rsquo;s use the <a tabindex="-1" href="https://5thsrd.org/gamemaster_rules/monsters/hell_hound/">Hell Hound</a> in the SRD as a guinea pig. A quick overview of their stat block is telling: These dogs are not tactically sophisticated. Their Intelligence is only 6. With a high Wisdom and proficiency in Perception, I would probably use Hell Hounds as hunting dogs for fiends, or other evil-aligned creatures who could find (and tame!) one.</p>
        <p>Hell Hounds have one damage immunity: fire. Apart from <spell>fireball</spell> and lower-levelled fire-elemental spells, I think it&rsquo;s unlikely for players to base their damage output entirely on fire in particular, so this will not affect their Hit Point count. That leaves them with 7d8+14 hit points, an average of <strong>45.5</strong>.
        <p>AC is a bit more involved. A Hell Hound&rsquo;s Armor Class is 15; I like to factor in their major saving throw bonuses, which are +1, +2, and +1 for their Dexterity, Constitution, and Wisdom, respectively. I roll saving throws the same way as attack rolls, against a static &lsquo;Saving Throw <caps>AC</caps>&rsquo;. The conversion is easy: just add 14. I like to count <caps>AC</caps>&ndash;saves in a 75&ndash;25 ratio:
        <p><eq>15 &times; 0.75 + (15 (<em>Dex</em>) + 16 (<em>Con</em>) + 15 (<em>Wis</em>)) &divide; 3 &times; 0.25 = <strong>15.1</strong></eq></p>
        <p>Next, let&rsquo;s calculate their damage output. A Hell Hound&rsquo;s <strong>bite</strong> attack deals 7.5 + 7 = 14.5 damage on average. Their <strong>fire breath</strong> is a bit more involved: as is usual for attacks that hit an area, let&rsquo;s assume two targets are caught in the blast. Each target takes 21 damage on average, so 21 + 21 = 42 damage in all. <strong>Fire breath</strong> has a 1 in 3 chance of recharging, so it will be used once, on average. Putting all of that together:
        <p><eq>(14.5 + 14.5 + 42) &divide; 3 = <strong>23.7</strong> damage per turn.</eq></p>
        <p>Calculating their Attack Bonus is easier. Hell Hounds have the <strong>pack tactics</strong> trait, which gives them an extra +3 bonus from advantage, on top of their base attack bonus of +5. Their <strong>fire breath</strong> is not rolled with advantage, though. It has a <caps>DC</caps> 12 saving throw, which is the same as an attack bonus of 12&nbsp;-&nbsp;8&nbsp;=&nbsp;4 (The <strong>fire breath</strong> save <caps>DC</caps> is calculated as 8 + Constitution modifier + proficiency). We know that this <strong>fire breath</strong> will be used once to hit 2 targets:</p>
        <p><eq>(2 &times; (5 + 3) + 2 &times; 4) &divide; 4 = <strong>+6</strong> bonus to hit.</eq></p>
        <p>Type in all of those numbers in the calculator above and check the box labeled <strong>creature level</strong>: <strong>6.7</strong>. Rounding that up to the nearest number, a hell-hound is a level <strong>7</strong> creature, using <caps>TNL</caps> rules.</p>
        <h1>Bossbuilding: Cattle-Plague</h1>
        <p><quote>It is early summer in Hylloch, a small town on the edge of the Greenlake. The harvest is shaping up to be a good one, and Lord Forsythe has called for woodcutters to expand the town with lumber from the neighboring Bolderwood. A massive corral was built in which cattle is kept from the various farmers living in town. A sturdy fence surrounds the prized beasts, and the gate is dutifully locked each evening by a servant from Forsythe manor. One day, shock! A cow&rsquo;s hind lies in a muddy patch, cut clean in two, the front half nowhere to be found. Who could have done this?</quote></p>
        <cred>Credit to <a tabindex="-1" href="https://youtu.be/y_zl8WWaSyI?t=981">this Matthew Colville video</a> for the inspiration.</cred>
        <p>This could be a fun intro-level quest to defeat an <strong>ankheg</strong> or another large beast, raised by a crazy hermit who living in the Bolderwood. The ankheg in the Monster Manual is a bit boring, though, so let&rsquo;s spice it up a little. If we want to build our boss for 4 level 1 players, we would need a creature of level 6 for a Medium encounter. There is a significant bump in ability at levels 5, 11, and 17 for both players and creatures though, so let&rsquo;s go with a conservative level <strong>5</strong> (200 XP).</p>
        <p>I like my bosses to be dynamic encounters, so this Cattle-Plague should have multiple actions to  shake up the party. As a start, let&rsquo;s give it a bite attack that also inflicts a grapple; if we throw in the ankheg&rsquo;s digestive acid, that should provide incentive to get out, <em>fast</em>. Let&rsquo;s keep the acid breath weapon, but it shouldn&rsquo;t deal much damage; our party is only 1st-level, after all. Instead, let&rsquo;s change it to corrode the target&rsquo;s armor. That might seem harsh&mdash;but since this is the boss, there will be a quest reward afterwards anyway. Finally, we&rsquo;ll give it two dynamic reactions: if it is hit for a large amount of damage, its carapace will break and pools of acid are spilled everywhere; and once its hit points start to dwindle, it will burrow underground, dragging grappled characters with it while it flees.</p>
        <p>Let&rsquo;s start by entering what we already know: a level (<strong>5</strong>). That gives us some values to work with. A giant insect is probably not very dextrous. It will probably have a decent Constitution score, and a lower-than-average Wisdom. Let&rsquo;s arbitrarily choose a -1, +2, and -1 modifier for each of those ability scores, giving it an average saving throw &lsquo;<caps>AC</caps>&rsquo; of <strong>13.7</strong>. We&rsquo;d need an <caps>AC</caps> of <strong>16.8</strong> to compensate. So let&rsquo;s give it <caps>AC</caps> 17, and keep the beast&rsquo;s underbelly unprotected as a bonus for players who think to flip it over. Let&rsquo;s put the beast&rsquo;s hit points slightly below the recommended value, at <strong>52</strong>.</p>
        <p>That leaves just the attacks. An effective attack bonus of may be a bit much to handle for a 1st-level party, though; let&rsquo;s drop that to 6. That also gives us a bit more damage to spread around the various attacks we had planned. First, let&rsquo;s get the basic bite and the acid breath out of the way:</p>
        <p><strong>Bite.</strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., 1 target. <em>Hit:</em> 5 (2d4+2) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 12).</p>
        <p><strong>Acid Spray (Recharge 5-6).</strong> One target Cattle-Plague can see within 30 feet must make a <caps>DC</caps> 12 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it takes 2d6 acid damage. If the target is wearing armor, it corrodes and their armor class is permanently reduced by 1. If this reduces the armor&rsquo;s AC to 10, it is destroyed. On a successful saving throw, the target only takes half damage, and their armor is not corroded.</p>
        <p>Reducing a target&rsquo;s <caps>AC</caps> indirectly raises the probability of our attacks hitting; so our attack bonus is still higher than the +5 from the bite. Let&rsquo;s also add a trait to codify the beast&rsquo;s digestive juices:</p>
        <p><strong>Acid Saliva.</strong> A target grappled by Cattle-Plague takes 1d4 acid damage at the start of each of their turns.</p>
        <p>That puts our damage output at (2 &times; (2d4+2 + 1d4) + 2d6) &divide; 3 = <strong>8.7</strong> damage per turn. So we have 11.4 - 8.7 = <strong></strong>2.7</strong> damage to divide between the acid pools and the fight-or-flight response:</p>
        <p><strong>Splintering Carapace.</strong> Once Cattle-Plague takes a total of 20 damage, its carapace splinters, spilling acid in a 5-feet circle centered on itself. This acid deals 1d4 acid damage whenever a creature enters the area for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there. The acid disappears after 1 minute.</p>
        <p><strong>Flight.</strong> Once Cattle-Plague drops to 17 hit points or below, it can immediately burrow up to its speed as a reaction.</p>
        <p>And our boss creature is complete! All that is left is the adventure itself, which I leave for you to write :P</p>
